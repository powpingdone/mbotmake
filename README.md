# NOTE
This repository is unstable. Until I add basic stable support (full support for G0/1, G92, G90/91, bed, chamber, and nozzle heating) for all Makerbot Gen5 Printers, please use with caution. I am not responsible for any broken printers, but do feel free to [make an issue](https://github.com/sckunkle/mbotmake/issues) with what happened.

# mbotmake
